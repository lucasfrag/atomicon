Task: Determine the final verdict of a claim based on evidence.

Claim:
{context.claim}

---

Supporting evidence:
{support_text}

---

Refuting evidence:
{refute_text}

---

Instructions:

- Compare supporting and refuting evidence carefully
- If strong contradiction exists → REFUTED
- If evidence clearly supports → SUPPORTED
- If evidence is weak or insufficient → NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE
- If both strong support and refutation exist → CONFLICTING

Be conservative:
- Prefer REFUTED over SUPPORTED when conflict exists

If evidence is irrelevant or inconsistent with the claim, do NOT support the claim.

---

Output:
Return ONLY one label:

SUPPORTED
REFUTED
NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE
CONFLICTING
